# Boxing-Replay
A short browser script for when you're watching boxing matches and maybe there was a quick exchange that slipped your eye, fret not - Just hit backspace and it'll play back the last 3 seconds in 0.5 speed with the volume muted(It's annoying when it's not), and then resumes back to normal speed and volume.
